## Arrays

Arrays are specified by first declaring their axis lengths, `[2][3]` for example, then the data type as in `[2][3]float32`.

Arrays of `string` are not supported.

```code:main
package main

func Main() [2][3]float32 {
    return [2][3]float32{
        {1, 2, 3},
        {4, 5, 6},
    }
}
```
